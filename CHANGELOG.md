## [Unreleased]

### Planning (pre-code)
- Master plan (`docs/planning/master-plan.md`) finalised — classification,
  detection, segmentation, zero-shot, training, reproducibility.
- Phase roster locked: 22 phases grouped into 7 versions (v0.1 → v2.5+).
- Setup guides written for Hugging Face gated-model access and local LLM
  backend (MedGemma 1.5 via Ollama / LM Studio).
- Root `CLAUDE.md` written with iron rules and multi-phase management
  discipline.
- Repository renamed to `OpenPathAI`; earlier planning drafts archived under
  `docs/planning/archive/`.

### Planning — pre-Phase-0 corrections (2026-04-23)

- LICENSE + NOTICE copyright updated to
  `Dr. Atul Tiwari, Vedant Research Labs, and OpenPathAI contributors`.
- Hugging Face setup guide corrections:
  - MedGemma link fixed to https://huggingface.co/google/medgemma-1.5-4b-it.
  - Hibou split into Hibou-b (ViT-B/14) and Hibou-L (ViT-L/14) with
    laptop-fit notes.
  - SPIDER-breast and SPIDER-colorectal models + datasets added (Histai
    organ-specific).
  - CTransPath clarified — recommend `kaczmarj/CTransPath` mirror, note
    `jamesdolezal/CTransPath` alternative.
  - Params + laptop-fit columns added to the gated-model table.
- Master plan updates:
  - §10.1 adds SPIDER-breast and SPIDER-colorectal as first-class tile
    datasets.
  - §11.3 gains params + laptop-fit columns; Hibou split b / L.
  - New §11.3a "Tier C-organ" registers SPIDER model+dataset pairs as
    first-class organ-specific pathology models.
  - §11.3b formalises the five foundation-model usage patterns (frozen
    features, fine-tune, MIL backbone, zero-shot, ready-to-use classifier).
- README updated to list Hibou-b / Hibou-L and SPIDER in the capabilities
  table, and to record the future docs-site URL
  (https://atultiwari.github.io/OpenPathAI/).
- GitHub Pages confirmed configured to "GitHub Actions" source; live URL
  activates after the first successful `docs.yml` run in Phase 0.

### Phase 0 (in progress)
